
1.	Create a web-based Asset Inventory & Asset Allocation application for Light Microfinance Pvt Ltd with a clean, modern UI, company branding, and support for light and dark mode toggle across the entire application.
2.	Design a cool login page with role-based authentication, JWT security, session timeout, account lock after failed attempts, forgot password, and forced password change on first admin login.
3.	Implement three user roles: Admin (full access), Verifier (verification and image upload), and Employee (view-only access to their allocated assets).
4.	Build an Employee Master module with Excel upload, manual add/edit, bulk update, search, filter, and fields like Employee ID, Name, Branch, Department, Designation, Mobile, Email, Status, and Date of Joining.
5.	Build an Asset Master module where Admin can create asset types (Laptop, Mouse, Pendrive, Mobile, etc.) and dynamically add, remove, reorder, enable, or disable asset-related fields.
6.	Allow Admin to define asset field properties such as required/optional, field type (text, number, date, dropdown), default values, validation rules, and unique constraints (for example, serial number uniqueness).
7.	Create an Asset Allocation module where Admin selects an employee and asset type, and a popup/modal dynamically loads asset fields for data entry.
8.	Support asset quantity tracking and asset status management including Available, Allocated, Returned, Damaged, Lost, and Scrapped, with automatic availability updates.
9.	Enable multiple image upload per asset with drag-and-drop, preview, compression, tagging, and deletion support.
10.	Provide a Verifier module where verifier users can verify asset details, upload additional images, add remarks, approve or reject assets, and maintain verification history.
11.	Implement Asset Return, Reallocation, and Replacement workflows with reason capture and status tracking.
12.	Maintain complete asset lifecycle history and audit trail, including allocation, return, verification, and admin modifications.
13.	Create an Admin dashboard with real-time statistics such as total assets, allocated assets, available assets, pending verification, returned assets, and damaged assets, with charts by branch and asset type.
14.	Add advanced global search and filters across employees, assets, serial numbers, branches, and statuses.
15.	Implement Excel import and export for employees, assets, allocations, verification records, and reports.
16.	Implement role-based page access and button-level permissions to prevent unauthorized actions.
17.	Generate an Asset Acknowledgement PDF upon allocation, including employee details, asset details, images, and declaration text, and automatically email the PDF to the employee and admin.
18.	Implement notification mechanisms (in-app and email-ready) for asset allocation, verification pending, approval, rejection, and return events.
19.	Implement API audit logs to record all API requests and actions, including user, role, timestamp, IP address, request type, and response status.
20.	Use PostgreSQL with a flexible and scalable schema to support dynamic fields and high data volume.
21.	Develop backend APIs using FastAPI or Django with proper validation, secure file handling, error logging, and performance optimization.
22.	Develop frontend using React with Tailwind CSS, ensuring responsive design, accessibility, and seamless dark/light mode switching.
23.	Provide default admin credentials:
o	Username: admin@lightmf.com
o	Password: Admin@123
o	Role: Super Admin
24.	Ensure the application supports environment-based configuration, backup-ready architecture, and future cloud deployment without major code changes.
